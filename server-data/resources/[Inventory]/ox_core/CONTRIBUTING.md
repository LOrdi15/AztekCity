# Contributing to Ox Core
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Submitting Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, provide tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the [documentation](https://github.com/overextended/overextended.github.io).
4. Ensure your coding style is consistent with the project.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/overextended/ox_core/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A clear and concise description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Provide sample code
  - If possible, code should not be dependent on a larger codebase
- What you expected would happen (expected behaviour)
- What actually happened
- Additional context and notes (i.e. why you think this is occurring, things you've tried to solve the issue)
- Screenshots or videos, where applicable
